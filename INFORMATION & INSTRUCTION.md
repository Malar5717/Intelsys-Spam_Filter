# SPAM FILTER:
## PROJECT OVERVIEW:
"Spam is a spreading issue worldwide. As technology advances, spammers continuously exploit loopholes to misuse it. Our goal is to develop a solution that filters spam content and proactively warns users to ensure a safer digital experience."

# PROJECT WORKFLOW:
## STARTING PLAN:
To build a Machine Learning model using Naive Bayes to implement Spam/Ham detection in email texts.

### Purpose of this Model development:
Building a Machine Learning model for filtering out the Spam emails helps you build a Basic knowledge on how that model works, how it is trained and how it predicts the answers.
This basic knowledge is important for us to move through the other Advanced Models and Platforms.

### Why Naive Bayes?üëá
Naive Bayes ML model is very efficient in Filtering out the messages as Spam/Ham and it is way easier to implement as a beginner.

### How it works?üëá
For example, let us consider the text, "Win a free iPhone"

"Win" + "free" + "iPhone"

The Naive Bayes classifier, checks each word's probability of it in spam or ham in the DataSet. Finally, it multiplies each word's probabilities to find the total probability of the sentence for SPAM and HAM respectively. If the Spam probability is high, then it is classified as a Spam email and vice versa...

To know more about Naive Bayes classification, Hey curious minds., I have attached a YouTube Video link below. Don't miss to check it out!

### A short guide to develop the Naive Bayes ML model for Spam detection:
[1] Let‚Äôs start by using the Na√Øve Bayes ML model ‚Äì due to its efficiency and easier implementation.

[2] Get a sample Data-Set for (Spam/Ham) emails - It will be available in the following link;

<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets> We can search for spam emails dataset here (A Sample Dataset is shared in WhatsApp group too)

[3] Load the dataset and train the model.

[4] Check for its accuracy.

[5] Print the Accuracy score, Confusion Matrix and Classification report.

[6] Then, provide any spam/ham email text as input to the model to check its functioning.

[7] Finally, create a simple User Interface - We Can use Streamlit, (HTML & CSS), Gradio and there are more to explore. In this, Tools like Streamlit and Gradio are in-built python Frameworks to develop Front-end.

[8] After all, We can try other ML models like SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and more‚Ä¶ to build the email classification model.

### FORK THIS REPOSITORY:
* Everyone should fork this repository and can start working on your Initial Machine Learning model at your free time. 

* Add your used codes as files and the explanation of how the model works, any special features etc in this Repository.

* On January you have to explain the working of your Model and about any special features you have added!!

## NEXT BIG PLAN:
After the completion and submission of the initial model, We are gonna jump into a bigger Idea of Implementing the Spam Detection in wide platforms like Instagram, Gmail and Reddit as a Team.

We are going to develop it as a Mobile App which would run over those apps and provide live detection on Spam messages and comments and warns the Users...

## WELCOMING NEW IDEAS:
* Feel free to share any suggestion or any new Ideas to develop this project in our Spam Filter groupüëç
